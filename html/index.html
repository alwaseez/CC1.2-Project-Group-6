        <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species
          endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. </p>

        <p>The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
          Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making
          up more than 99% of its diet.Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even
          meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub
          leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>

        <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring
          Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been
          driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A
          2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. By December
          2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 countries. Wild population
          estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006
          study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.</p>

    <h3 class='username'>Classification</h3>
    <p class='comment'>For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate
      because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.</p>
